This is my revised portion for Learning Group Project H.
   
###Introduction 
Purpose of this investigation is to explore whether indivdiuals from different economic backgrounds and ethnicities score differently on reading tests. I am particularly interested in whether or not there is an interaction between the two explanatory variables.  
Research Question: Is there an interaction between socioeconomic status and ethnicity on reading scores?
